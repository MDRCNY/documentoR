Here's a concise summary of the gander package documentation:

```markdown
### SUMMARY
The gander package provides a Copilot-like completion experience for R, integrating large language model chats directly into RStudio and Positron sessions. It automatically incorporates context from surrounding code and the global environment, allowing users to interact with the assistant via a keyboard shortcut.

### KEY_ITEMS
- `gander_addin()`: Main function to run the gander addin
- `gander_options`: Configuration options for the package
- `gander_peek()`: Function to inspect the most recent chat interaction

### FUNCTIONS/EXPORTS
- `gander_addin()`: Run the gander addin in RStudio
- `gander_peek()`: Return the ellmer Chat object from the most recent gander interaction

### DEPENDENCIES/MIGHT_USE
Imports: cli, glue, ellmer, miniUI, rlang, rstudioapi, shiny, streamy, treesitter, treesitter.r
Suggests: gt, knitr, rmarkdown, testthat, tibble, withr

### TODO / WARNINGS
- The package requires R 4.3.0 or higher
- Some functions require an interactive RStudio session and access to the RStudio API
- An active connection to an LLM API is necessary for the addin to function

### SUGGESTED_TESTS
1. Test `gander_addin()` with different `.gander_chat` options to ensure compatibility with various models
2. Verify that `gander_peek()` correctly returns the most recent chat interaction
3. Test the addin's behavior with different `.gander_dims` settings to ensure proper data context handling

### SHORT_RECOMMENDATION
Expand documentation with more detailed usage examples and consider adding support for additional IDE integrations beyond RStudio and Positron.
